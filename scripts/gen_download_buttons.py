"""Generate the README's download buttons from one template.

From a template, because hand-drawn buttons are chances to type one number
differently, and the point of a row of them is that they look like one control
repeated.

THE GEOMETRY is ArrowLoop's, so the buttons here and there are the same object:
245.3 tall with rx 38.2, which is the Buy Me a Coffee button's own height and
corner, and 720 wide rather than that button's 841.9 because at 841.9 a third
of the face sits empty next to the longest word.

THE COLOUR is the thing's own and there is no outline (jdp: "die butotns sollen
keine rahmenliniehaben und farbig sein"). A filled shape in a colour somebody
already associates with the thing does the work an outline was doing, faster:
the eye finds "the blue one" before it reads the word.

WHAT A CONTAINER REPO ACTUALLY OFFERS is not a bundle, it is an image, and a
browser cannot download one of those: a click on it can only open a page. So
the first button downloads the `docker-compose.yml` instead, which IS a file
and is the thing somebody needs in order to run the image. It is attached to
every release, because a release asset is served with Content-Disposition
attachment and therefore actually downloads, where a raw file in the repo would
open as text in a tab.

The second button is the source archive, and it is labelled as exactly that.
GitHub attaches "Source code (zip)" to every release automatically: it is the
whole repository at that tag, not the Dockerfile alone. Calling it anything
else on the button would send somebody looking for an image to a folder of
YAML.

THE GLYPHS are Font Awesome Free (icons CC BY 4.0), from the brands set and
the solid one. The brand marks are trademarks of their owners and are used the
one way a trademark may be used without permission: to name the thing they
point at. Each button links to that thing, the marks are unmodified, and
nothing here claims endorsement by anyone.

The source button carries a ZIP glyph rather than the GitHub mark, because
what it hands over is an archive, not a visit to GitHub. The mark named the
host; the glyph names the file.

Run from anywhere:  python scripts/gen_download_buttons.py
Writes .github/assets/download-buttons/*.svg, which are committed, and the
button rows in README.md between their markers, all of them showing one
sprite, .github/assets/download-buttons/buttons.svg.

# THE SHEEN IS DEFINED ON SCREEN, NOT ON THIS CANVAS, and that sentence is the

#
# A tilted white band, clipped to the button, crossing once every seven seconds:
# the donation row's own, and the point is that it is the SAME band there and
# here. It was not. Both rows described their band in their own canvas units,
# and the two canvases differ (720 here, 841.9 there) as do the widths the
# READMEs render them at (195 here, 160 there), so what reached the page was a
# 38px band at 304px per second above a 31px band at 249. Two effects on one
# page, which is what got reported.
#
# So the three numbers below are in SCREEN pixels and are the same for every row
# in the house (see the GitHub style guide, "Der Schein"). Everything else is
# derived from the width this row is rendered at.
#
# THE GAP IS MEASURED, not assumed. The row is `<img width="195">` with a
# newline, two spaces and a `&nbsp;` between the images, which HTML collapses to
# space-nbsp-space: 13.16px at GitHub's 16px body text, measured in a browser.
# It used to be taken as 4px, which left the band hanging in the gap 17% too
# long here - the visible half of the defect.
#
# The separator matters and is part of the rule: `&nbsp;` glued to the closing
# `</a>` instead of standing on its own line measures 8.77px, and a row written
# that way needs its own number.

# GitHub's own colour is black, and a black button without an outline vanishes
# into GitHub's dark theme, exactly as a black macOS button did in ArrowLoop's
# row. The slate below stays visible on both themes.
#
# The delay is the button's POSITION times STEP, computed below rather than
# written out here: a hand-kept column of seconds is a column somebody edits the
# row without touching, and then the band hands off into nothing.
#
# THIS ROW STARTS AT ZERO because it is the FIRST row on the page. One band
# works its way down the README rather than one band per row running beside the
# others: the whole first row, then the whole second. The give row below carries
# the other half of that schedule - a fixed 3.8s offset, which is when the
# longest download row in the house (ArrowLoop's four buttons) has finished. It
# has to be a fixed number rather than a derived one, because those three
# buttons are one shared asset referenced by twenty-six repositories and cannot
# know what a given README puts above them.
#
# The last column is where the button leads. It lives here with the rest of the
# button because this file writes the README row too, see write_readme().

# THE README ROWS are written here as well, between markers, so a button added
# to BUTTONS reaches the page by running this file and nothing else: the
# download row, and every donation row (the one under the description and the one in
# Support).
#
# ALL OF THEM SHOW ONE FILE, buttons.svg, each button through its own
# #svgView fragment inside its own link. The shine is a CSS animation, and a
# browser runs it on a clock that starts when that <img> gets its file. Separate
# files arrive at separate moments, so the band jumped between buttons; and
# Firefox reuses an image it already has when GitHub swaps the page without a
# reload, starting a new clock on it. One file arrives once for every button on
# the page and all of its <img> are inserted together, so all clocks start
# together: the download row, then the donation row, in order. That is
# also why the donation buttons are copied into this file rather than linked
# from the profile repository's give.svg: two files would be two arrivals again.
# Measured on github.com in Firefox, loaded fresh and after in-page navigation.
# The layout of a sprite is explained in
# junkerderprovinz/junkerderprovinz, donate/buttons/sprite.mjs.
#
# The donation buttons are read from the profile repository when this runs, so
# after they change there, run this again. The sprite is read from main, so a
