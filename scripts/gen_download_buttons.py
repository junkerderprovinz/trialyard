"""Generate the README's download buttons from one template.

One template, so the buttons of a row cannot drift apart. The geometry is
ArrowLoop's: 245.3 tall with rx 38.2, the Buy Me a Coffee button's height and
corner, and 720 wide rather than its 841.9, which would leave a third of the
face empty next to the longest word. Each button is filled in the colour people
already associate with its target, with no outline.

A browser cannot download an image, so the first button downloads the
docker-compose.yml attached to every release: a release asset is served as an
attachment, where a raw file in the repo would open as text. The second button
is the source archive GitHub attaches to every release, and says so.

The glyphs are Font Awesome Free (icons CC BY 4.0), from the brands and solid
sets. The brand marks are trademarks of their owners, used unmodified and only
to name what each button links to, with no claim of endorsement. The source
button carries a ZIP glyph because it hands over an archive, not a visit to
GitHub.

Run from anywhere:  python scripts/gen_download_buttons.py
Writes .github/assets/download-buttons/*.svg, which are committed, and the
button rows in README.md between their markers, all of them showing one
sprite, .github/assets/download-buttons/buttons.svg.
